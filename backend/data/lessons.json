      "content": "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly web applications. It was created by Facebook and is now maintained by Facebook and the community. React allows you to create reusable UI components and manage the state of your application efficiently.\n\n## Key Features of React:\n\n1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state\n2. **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM for better performance\n3. **Declarative**: Describe what the UI should look like for any given state\n4. **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: Use React for web, mobile, and desktop applications\n\n## Why Use React?\n\n- **Popular and In-Demand**: One of the most popular frontend frameworks\n- **Great Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling and ecosystem\n- **Performance**: Virtual DOM and efficient rendering\n- **Community**: Large community and extensive resources",
